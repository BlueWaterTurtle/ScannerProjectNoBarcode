This app is considered a 1.0 
It fills the niche it was created for. I may add more features or make it prettier but for now, it's in a good place to leave it. 

This script is designed to speed up users workflows, It will rename documents dropped in a specified directory to a name it discoveres. 
This will specifically find a "PO" on a page and rename the document to the PO that it finds.
